Please note!

The repository is in flux, as we are merging in a branch where the code part has been rewritten in FastHTML. Documentation is on the way...


# SHMARQL

A SPARQL endpoint explorer, that allows you to "bounce" the _subject_, _predicate_ or _object_ around for a public SPARQL endpoint so that you can explore the shape of the data.
useful if you encounter a new dataset that you do not know and would like to quickly get a feel of what the data looks like.

## Running

You can test/run a local copy, if you have Docker installed by doing:

```shell
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 -it ghcr.io/epoz/shmarql:v0.39
```

You can then view it in your browser at: [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)

## Using the built-in triplestore

SHMARQL also has a built-in triplestore which you can use to share your RDF data over a SPARQL interface. To use it, you need to specify the path from which to load the datafiles at startup, using an environment variable: `DATA_LOAD_PATHS`.
This also means that the path in which the data is stored is is "visible" to the docker container via for example a mounted volume.

Here is an example, where you have some .ttl files stored in a directory named `./databases`

```shell
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 -it -v $(pwd)/databases:/data -e DATA_LOAD_PATHS=/data  ghcr.io/epoz/shmarql:v0.39
```

This will load all .ttl files found in the specified directory, and make it available under a /sparql endpoint, eg. http://localhost:8000/sparql

## Development instructions

If you would like to run and modify the code in this repo, there is a [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) which includes the necessary versions of the required libraries.

First, build the Docker image like so:

```shell
docker build -t shmarql .
```

Now you can run a local copy with:

```shell
docker run -it --rm -p 8000:8000 shmarql
```
